          <h2>Who is Elle?</h2>
          <p>Elle Pope is from small home Wisconsin living in big city Seattle. They are a creator who strives for the functional, the bizarre, and the new. They enjoy discussion and discovery, for the world is one that needs more thought.</p>
          <p>Elle's Ultimate goal is to create alternate forms of communication in media in order to encourage and harbor positivity and critical thinking in today's youth. Growing up in a secluded place, Elle noticed that many people who went against the norm were often pushed away from the community. Internet, video games, and writing became safe havens for these people who used these media to communicate in an otherwise hostile environment. Although things are getting much better, further work is needed.</p>
          <p>Beyond their work, Elle enjoys reading about advances in mathematics, science, psychology, and anthropology. They also enjoy running, playing with their pet rats, and engaging with people. Currently, they are a member of SeaSAW (Seattle Society of Artists and Writers) where members work on new forms of creativity to keep the mind sharp</p>
